Project JURAL

This project was created as part of a study on the practical limits of applying “AI” technologies to software development.
This repository begins a collection of free Windows console utilities developed with the assistance of ChatGPT.

The primary goals are to improve the performance and capabilities of standard tools, explore low-level file and device operations, optimize processing speed, and minimize system overhead.

Implemented utilities

Search for text fragments in large text files — encoding-independent, byte-level matching.

Search for binary fragments in large binary files

Planned utilities

Editing of text and binary files: positional and context-based insertion/replacement

Filtering of text and binary files using complex conditions

Search/removal/thinning of duplicate lines in text files

Comparing text files with substring-level precision

Transliteration of text files

Construction of frequency dictionaries

Extended binary file dump

CSV → table conversion

Comparing CSV files by arbitrary combinations of fields

Detecting duplicates in CSV files by arbitrary combinations of fields

Filtering CSV files by arbitrary combinations of fields
